YOUR MISSION: Clear the Asteroids and Mines

Use the up and down arrows to move
Use the spacebar for blasting!

Blasters will heat up with use ( offline over 90% )
Use the blasters sparingly to blast the asteroids and mines

Cleanup Bonus : 50%+ Blast Accuracy with 50%+ Hazards Cleared
Cleared percentage * 25 points ( e.g. 80% * 25 = 20 points )

Blasting a flaming asteroid causes a blue orb to appear
The blue orb gives 10 bonus points and resets blaster heat
